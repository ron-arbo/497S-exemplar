# Accessing Yelp API

## Group E

This is a quick example of how to use python to communicate with the Yelp APIs which we will use for our website to return data on potential destinations for groups to meet up

As of now the parameters for the exemplar are hard coded but we will eventually modify the file to take a POST request from another microservice and in return sent out another request with the given information, most likely as a JSON.
